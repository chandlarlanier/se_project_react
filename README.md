# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The WTWR App is a weather-based clothing recommendation application that helps users decide what to wear based on the current weather conditions. It fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API and dynamically renders the weather information. Additionally, the app allows users to submit and manage their clothing items, providing personalized clothing recommendations based on the weather data received.

## Objective

- This project primarily focuses on mastering the basic concepts of React and React Router, such as creating components, managing state, handling data fetched from an external API, and allowing navigation between displays.

## Features

- React Router Integration: The app uses React Router to provide navigation between the main weather display and the user's profile section. Users can seamlessly switch between these sections to view weather information and manage their clothing items.

- Real-time Weather Data: By integrating with the OpenWeather API, the project demonstrates the ability to retrieve and display real-time weather information to users. This involves making API requests, processing JSON data, and presenting it in a user-friendly manner.

- Personalized Clothing Recommendations: Understanding and interpreting weather data allows the WTWR app to offer tailored clothing suggestions. This feature showcases the application of logical algorithms and conditional rendering in providing practical solutions.

- Clothing Management: Users have the ability to add and delete clothing items from their profiles. This flexibility ensures that users can maintain an up-to-date inventory of their clothing options.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for structuring the project's web pages.
- CSS: Applied for styling and layout design.
- JavaScript: The primary programming language used for the project's functionality.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
