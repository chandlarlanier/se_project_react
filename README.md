# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The WTWR App fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API and dynamically renders the current weather conditions. Additionally, the app generates a curated list of recommended clothing items based on the weather data received. Whether it's sunny, rainy, cold, or hot, the WeatherWear App ensures that users are well-prepared for the day ahead.

## Main Objectives

- Learn React Fundamentals: This project primarily focuses on mastering the basic concepts of React. By creating components, managing state, and handling data fetched from an external API, developers will gain valuable hands-on experience in building modern web applications.

- Real-time Weather Data: By integrating with the OpenWeather API, the project demonstrates the ability to retrieve and display real-time weather information to users. This involves making API requests, processing JSON data, and presenting it in a user-friendly manner.

- Personalized Clothing Recommendations: Understanding and interpreting weather data allows the WeatherWear App to offer tailored clothing suggestions. This feature showcases the application of logical algorithms and conditional rendering in providing practical solutions.
